       "['very intentionally) following this rule: get great people, worry about steering the boat later. When I first read Graham’s statement about being certain about being able to find a money making idea if he had the right founders, I was pretty hesitant. Indeed, I found the statement to come off as slightly arrogant. After reading more of his works, and of a number of other books and articles (and also monitoring the success of the Y-Combinator companies), it seems more and more that what he said is true: with the right people, the boat may as well steer itself.Alright, now weave Ayn Rand into this web for usIf we look at the heroes in Ayn Rand’s novels, they are all extremely competent, driven by a need to conform to incredibly high standards, and exceptionally selfless (and they are all men, because Ayn Rand believed women existed to worship men, which is pointedly not</strong/> an argument ever made by either Paul Graham or Jim Collins; on a slightly</em/> different note the Passions of Ayn Rand is a great book and I recommend it to everyone).Rand’s heroes deeply desire to work with one another (as evidenced by their joint retreat to form their own country at the end of Atlas Shrugged), and they are eternally frustrated when working with others who are not the “right” kind. Dorothy Taggert finds the one competent lineworker, and desperately attempts to promote him into a position of authority; she does this because she knows the Good to Great</em/> secret, that the “right”',\n",

Hopefully now that I have put it out there, I will receive some interesting feedback. Initially I wanted to connect Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi into the web, but I realized that that</em/> connection was really</em/> tenuous, and mostly the consequence of my enduring interest in his work (rather than the result of a strong parallel of concepts, although the autotelic concept–so finely honed by Mihaly–is prevalent in Good to Great).I really would recommend anyone to read through Good to Great</em/>, its a pleasant read, and probably wouldn’t take more than 4-8 hours to read, depending on your reading speed (its about 240 pages, but not particularly dense or difficult reading).',\n",
       " 'This is a transplant from the original Irrational Exuberance, and was written in mid 2007: nearly two years ago. It was my first article to be read outside of my immediate group of friends and was picked up on Reddit programming. It is unquestionably quaint, but I only started proofreading my blog entries in the past six months, so I won’t profess a particularly strong attachment to perfection.\\nA friend recently asked me to throw together my thoughts on using Django as a development framework, so here is an attempt to oblige him, and also solidify my opinion on Django in general. For the past two (maybe three…) weeks Django has been at the forefront of my day, each and every day, for most of the day. When I began, I had never used Django before, but at this point I have read a fair quantity of its source (which is something of a requirement, when you want to do something tricky, as their documentation–especially on newer components–is spotty), and would consider myself fairly competent at using the framework. So, without further ado, here we go.',\n",
       " 'I have been meaning to write an entry about programming and what we can learn about programming from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\\'s book \"Flow\". Initially I was intending to write a rather scholarly article about it, but my work towards that end has lost momentum, so here--out of the desire to put forth something on this topic--is a less-ambitiously-groundbreaking-than-intended entry about learning to program better, and to enjoy it more fully, by applying the lessons of \"Flow\". Mihaly puts forth eight criteria that are typical indicators of being in the state of flow. They are:\\nI think anyone who enjoys programming can see themselves in some of those criteria. How often have you sat down and lost track of time, and come back to reality five hours later with this calm (although, sometimes raging) sense of accomplishment? This may happen to you frequently, or not, but lets think about what we can do to encourage it happening as much as possible.',\n",
       " \"The rest (5-8) are more descriptive than perscriptive, but they are still interesting to consider. In particular, I enjoy the seeming paradox of number seven. We learn to value ourselves based on what we are capable of, but at the actual time we are creating, we are unaware of ourselves (lost in the act of programming). Amazing to imagine oneself simply ceasing to exist sometimes, and THAT is when we do our best work--when we don't exist. A bit humbling in some ways (also strikes me as very much Zen Buddhist).I strongly recommend running out and reading Flow. Its great. Also, you might want to check out Blink by Malcolm Gladwell at at the same time. It hits some of the same stuff from a very different (but still interesting) angle. I'd love to hear any responses or comments!\"]"

(Counterfactual evaluation via Inverse Propensity Scoring is another alternative.)\n",
      "How does bandit off-policy evaluation compare to typical supervised machine learning evaluation on logged data? Twitter’s paper provides some insight. They computed two sets of metrics: (i) PR-AUC on a standard test set and (ii) CTR improvements vs. a random policy. There was a trade-off between PR-AUC and CTR.\n",
      "Although the greedy policy performed well on PR-AUC, it did relatively poorly on CTR. Conversely, bandit policies such as UCB and Thompson Sampling did poorer on PR-AUC but outperformed the greedy policy on CTR. This shows the divergence where supervised learning that evaluates well on biased logged data via conventional metrics may not actually perform well on the metrics we really care about (e.g., CTR, conversion).\n",
      "Whew, that was a lot longer than the average post. If you’re still with me, I hope you found bandits to be a viable alternative for recommendation systems. Their focus on modeling uncertainty and deliberate exploration makes them effective when our data is small and we have low certainty on user-item preferences.\n"

      "2023-04-03 09:41:14,857 - Content: That was a whirlwind tour of the various patterns for personalization in recommendations and search. These patterns are not exhaustive. I’ve also come across papers that add multi-interest heads and learn interest hierarchies on top of user interests, as well as approaches to model user interest across domains. When to use which? Here’s a rough heuristic:\n",
      "If you’re starting with personalization, good ol’ logistic regression with crossed features is a tough baseline to beat. If you’re building a real-time recommender (i.e., generates recs on request), learning item embeddings via word2vec and applying approximate nearest neighbors is pretty lean and gets much of the juice from session-level behavioral data.\n",
